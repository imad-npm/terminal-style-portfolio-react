  I earned my Master’s degree in Information Systems and Data (SID) from the
  University of Science and Technology of Oran (USTO), where I focused on
  building a strong foundation in software development, system architecture,
  and data engineering. Throughout the program, I worked on projects involving
  Big Data, Cloud Computing, distributed systems, and data security, which
  helped me develop both technical depth and problem-solving skills. I also
  explored topics like machine learning, data warehousing, and project
  management, gaining practical experience in handling and analyzing complex
  datasets.
